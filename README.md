Architecture Overview
The Chattr application is designed with a modular, microservices-inspired architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability:

Frontend: Built with React, the frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs and handles real-time events using Socket.IO for instant updates.

Backend: A Node.js and Express-based REST API serves as the core of the application, handling user authentication, message storage, and Socket.IO connections for real-time messaging.

Database: MongoDB is used for data storage, offering a flexible schema for storing user and message data.

Authentication: Secure authentication using JWT ensures that only authorized users can access certain features.

Real-time Communication: Socket.IO enables real-time message exchange between clients, making conversations instantaneous.

Cloud Deployment: Chattr is containerized with Docker and can be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster for scalability and load balancing.
